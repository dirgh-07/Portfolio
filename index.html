                <h3>Automation For Installation Of Splunk App</h3>
                <p>This project involved the creation of a Splunk architecture using automation. I utilized Terraform for safe and
                    efficient infrastructure building, changing, and versioning. The Jenkins pipeline was implemented for continuous
                    testing and integration, creating a Splunk cluster architecture for the installation of the Splunk App. Additionally,
                    I used Ansible playbook for the installation steps and scripts needed to install the app on the Splunk cluster
                    architecture.</p>

                    laundering. Collected and stored client details, along with valid government issued ID , using KYC methods.
                    Utilized Python libraries NumPy, time, dlib, and cv2 to implement an AWS Rekognition-based method for liveness
                    detection in biometric verification, preventing the use of photographs in place of real individual</p>

                <p>This project utilized Amazon Web Services as its platform and involved the development of a chatbot. To create
                    the chatbot, I conducted surveys with several restaurants and cafes to identify the problems they faced. For backend, I used
                    services like Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda. Once developed, the chatbot was deployed on the
                    Facebook Messenger page of the cafe.</p>
